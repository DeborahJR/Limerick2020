### Expected Attendence

We expect an attendance of approximately 150 people (including speakers).
This figure is supplemented by the organizing team members and sponsors ( approximately 10-15)

### Event Promotion 

The event was announced in September 2019. 
It has been actively promoted on a regional level since the announcement, and on national level since October 2019 (i.e. just after PyCon Ireland 2019).

### PyCon Limerick 2019

PyCon Limerick is the second iteration of the PyCon Limerick series, and builds upon the success of PyCon Limerick 2019. 
In January 2019, PyCon Limerick 2019 was announced took place at the Limerick Strand Hotel on Saturday 29th March 2019.
The event comprised tracks with talks and workshops presented by 14 speakers.  There was approximately 60 attendees.
We noted that the timing coincided with project work deadlines with many third level students, and opted for an earlier date in the calendar for any subsequent events.

### Organizing Team

The event is organized both by Python Ireland, and a local organizing team lead by Kevin O'Brien.
This local team is expected to be joined by other Pythonistas in the mid-west region, who will manage PyCon Limerick on an ongoing basis.

### Keynotes

There are not keynote sessions. This removes constraints on the schedulig.
The format of the event is to maximise the number of available slots to give as many people an opportunity to gain speaking experience, and then progress to speaking at
larger events, e.g. PyCon Ireland, PyCon UK and Europython.
Several prominent keynote speakers are expected to be in attendance.

### Code of Conduct

The event will be organized under the Python Ireland Code of Conduct, which can be found on the event website (www.pycon.ie)
In the lead up to the event, an "on-the-day" plan will be finalized, with Code of Conduct responders being appointed.
