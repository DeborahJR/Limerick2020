# Pycon Limerick 2020

PyCon Limerick 2020 will be returing to Limerick on Saturday 29th February 2020.
This one day conference is a mixture of talks and workshops on topics related to the Python Programming Language.

Python Ireland is the Irish organization representing the various chapters of Python users. 
One of our key activities is the organization of Python Conferences. We have organized PyCon Ireland in Dublin over the last ten years.

PyCon Ireland is now a highlight in the Dublin Tech Community calendar, with 400 python users attending the conference each autumn. PyCons are very popular with companies looking to recruit new talent.

PyCon Limerick will take place on Saturday 29th February 2020 at the Strand Hotel Limerick.
We hope to bring 150-200 technologists and coders from around Ireland to the city next Spring.

We expect to present talks pertaining to
* Data Science and Machine Learning
* Big Data and Data Engineering
* Software Engineering and Development Operations
* Web Frameworks (i.e. Django)
* IOT, Sensors and Micropython
* Applications for Natural Sciences (e.g. Earth Observation, Environmental Monitoring)

We ran the inaugural PyCon Limerick last March. We hosted 60 attendees with 15 talks, in two conference rooms on the top floor of the Strand Hotel.

For the 2020 event, we will expand to use the entire top floor with the expectation of 120-150 attendees.

We were received delegates and speakers from companies such as: Analogue Devices, General Motors, Zalando, Millman Brown, Twilio, Rapid Ratings and Nokia Bell Labs.

We consider the event a great success and a great showcase for Limerick's potential.

We would be delighted to discuss a collaboration in more detail in the foreseeable future.
