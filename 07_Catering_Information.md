In the event of over-crowding, Serving stations may be located in the lobby area also (where the registration desk is located).


## Lunch

* There will not be full catering for Lunch.
* The pricing model for the conference is based on the expectation of a lot of students coming, who generally prefer cheaper tickets without lunch included.
* A lunch voucher can be purchased additionally for lunch served in the hotel.
