## A System for Exploring Big Scholarly Data through Graph-databases	

* Area: Python Data Science	
* Level: Beginner	
* Topic: In introduction into some commonly used parts of Python. (good for beginners)

### Abstract
My talk aims to present the results obtained from a research carried out in the field of Big Scholarly Data. 
The main contribution is the identification of the similarity between authors of scientific papers of the website DBLP, achieved through Text Mining techniques 
including Topic Modeling and Word Embedding with the aim of providing a shareable and further improved knowledge base. 

The search was conducted entirely in Python, the results were then added to a graph database of an existing project, GraphDBLP.
