Problems with websites were a critical process failure for Python Ireland 2019.
The PyCon Ireland Website was deployed 4 weeks before the event.

Good websites are critical to developing and maintaining good sponsor relations.
The lack of a website was the source of stinging criticism from several potential sponsors (although one of those relented, and sponsored the event)
Failure to address website issue will give rise to unacceptable reputational risk for Python Ireland, and will prejudice the viability of the company if not adddressed.


Website Specifications

  * Equivalently: PyCon.ie/2020.
  * When you type "PyCon.ie", it goes straight to "PyCon.ie/2020", where 2020 is the current edition.
  * Listing for Regional events would be included on that page.

* Regional Events will have URLs like PyCon.ie/Limerick2020 
* All events will be permanently archived, with the default URL switching to a current one.

### Template

* The Website should follow the format of the following sites

 - whyr.pl
 - devefest toulouse

* Python Ireland will provide still photography to use in the backgrounds.

### Components

 - Logistical Information
 - Code of Conduct Page

### Code of Conduct

* Lack of a prominent "code of conduct" on the event website will instantly disqualify the event from being sponsored by several large companies.
