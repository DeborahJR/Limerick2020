## Building smarter solutions with no expertise in machine learning	


* ML? API? AutoML? Python is the language of choice to solve problems with machine learning, but what can we build in only a few hours or days and without any expertise? 

* In this session, we'll see how to benefit from existing ML models and how to create a custom model with AutoML techniques. 

* Weâ€™ll also be active players of a live demo, so don't put your smartphone on airplane mode!
