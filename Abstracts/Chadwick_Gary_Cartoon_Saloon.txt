#### Tailoring Scripts to Fit	

"The development we do at Cartoon Saloon is inward focused, making tools that are very specific and tailored to the exact needs of our projects. Because of this controlled environment we can make certain assumptions about how the tools will be used. These assumptions allow our tools to do more, because they ""know"" more about our system.
For example, we have a render farm that exports scenes for our animators. But because we know exactly where we store our files and the format they're in, we can also automatically upload those videos to our online production tracking system.
My talk would explain this approach, how to write code in neat functions that can be broadly reusable. And then these basic functions can have more specific code built on top of them that's easy to modify and configure."
