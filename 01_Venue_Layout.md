### Audience

* We expect 100-150 attendees to come, with a lot of career-young professionals and university students.
* One of the intended outcomes of this event is about developing future talent.

* We will have a main track, with conventional PyCon style talks, and also a room (or rooms) for workshops.


### Venue Layout

The venue can be configured to have multiple small tracks running simultaneously. 

Please find a floor plan for the top floor of the Strand hotel attached in this github repository 
The configuration will be either 2 or 3 talk tracks

* 2 Tracks: O'Brien and Wogan as one room, Harris as the other
* 3 Tracks: O'Brien and Wogan as two separate rooms, with Harris as a third

#### Registration Area

* All attendees are asked to register at the 6th Floor Lobby.

#### Workshops 

* We will use the Henihan Suite for workshops.
* The main Sponsor area is the City View Suite as the Sponsors Area. This will also be the Coffee Area.
* We will remove the partition so that this Sponso Area area will actually take up part of the Harris Suite.
* It might get too crowded, so we might have a second coffee area in the lobby beside the lifts.

### End of Event

* The event will end at 5pm.
* We must vacate the conferece venue by 5:30pm.
* Attendees will be directed to a post PyCon social event at JJ Bowles Bar (i.e. the same venue as for the 2019 event.)
